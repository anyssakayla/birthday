- **1-2 days before**: Emphasize quick gift cards
- **Day of birthday**: Gift cards prominent, instant action

### Offline-First Architecture
- All features work without internet
- Local SQLite database is source of truth
- Changes queue for sync when online
- Optimistic UI updates

### Revenue Philosophy
- User value first, monetization second
- Transparent pricing (no hidden costs)
- Optional premium features
- Commission-based model doesn't cost users extra
